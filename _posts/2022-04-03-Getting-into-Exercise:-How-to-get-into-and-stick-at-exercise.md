Getting into exercise is something that everyone says they want to do, but a lot of people find it difficult to actually get around to doing it. Usually there is a reason -- something else to do, a lack of time, or possibly an injury -- that prevents you from exercising.

Exercise is important for a number of reasons we have all heard before, but it's worth a recap.

1.  Exercise can be highly beneficial for keeping you healthy.

2.  Exercise also can have a positive effect on mood and reduce stress. Ultimately you are doing something good for yourself.

A good way to get into exercise is to try something you've never tried before. There are many gyms around which offer classes in different styles of exercise. These could be things like yoga, pilates, zumba, circuit training, body weight training, spinning and many, many more. Many of these gyms or studios offer free trial classes or great introductory offers which allows you to try classes at different gyms and offers a free trial period. They are also a place where you can meet people who may be interested in similar things and on a similar fitness path to you. Lastly, it is always nice to have a structured workout planned and have someone there to correct your form if you are doing moves incorrectly, trainers always lead these classes and this is hugely beneficial to your experience.

However, if you prefer to exercise alone, prefer being outside or you need a focus point, a great idea is to book yourself into an endurance event in 6 months' time -- something like a swimming, running or cycling event, for example. By booking the event before you start training, it puts that 'end goal' in mind and gives you something to work towards. It's a nice idea to book this with someone else who you can train with, or chat with about training, to keep each other motivated.

If an injury is preventing you from getting back into exercise, it might be time to do something about that injury. The body is great at healing, but if you take charge of your health and get booked in with your health practictioner they will help assist this healing process.

Once you have started an exercise routine, you will start to notice changes in your body. At first, things will probably hurt a bit because the structures in your body are adapting to this new routine. This is most likely completely normal and okay!

Once you make a habit of exercising you are unlikely to want to stop, especially if you set yourself an end goal within your training routine. It doesn’t have to be an endurance event - it could be as straightforward as losing a certain amount of weight, running four miles in a certain amount of time, or being able to complete a difficult yoga pose. Make sure your goal is [SMART](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals). Ultimately, you will achieve your end goal, set new goals and maintain or build on the progress you’ve made. Good luck!
