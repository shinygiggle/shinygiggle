With working from home becoming a long term arrangement, experts are fearful it will lead to problems from bad posture to tension headaches

When 27-year old PhD student Laury Sellem started working from home at the beginning of lockdown, she was apprehensive. She was used to long hours standing in a laboratory, so the transition to sitting at a laptop for eight hours at a time felt unnatural.Â Around two weeks into lockdown, she started experiencing lower back pain, shoulder, neck and even numbness in her buttocks.

"I also became more prone to injuries while I was exercising," she says. "Over the course of threeÂ months, I blocked my back twice while doing yoga and injured my knee while running, even though I kept my routine similar to before lockdown."

At the end of the summer, Sellem's back was so painful that it starting interfering with daily activities, and even woke her up at night. Eventually, she sought help from a chiropractor, who said the pain was being caused by her posture. He advised Sellem to getÂ an external monitor for her laptop placed at eye level, and a footrest to stabilise the blood flow in her legs. "The chiropractor also showed me how to sit properly, keeping my shoulders back and avoid crossing my legs to reduce the strain on my back," she added.

Since I'll mostly be working from home until the end of my PhD, I've decided to upgrade myÂ [#WFH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WFH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)Â space! Very grateful to be able to afford all the equipment.

Sellem's situation is far from unique. According to figures from theÂ [British Association of Chiropractors (BCA)](https://chiropractic-uk.co.uk/), their website saw a 660 per cent increase in trafficÂ during lockdown, based on the same time last year. Data from a study undertaken in 2019 reveals that over 70 per cent of chiropractors have treated patients with injuries linked to sedentary lifestyle habits, such as screen time (78 per cent) and sitting for too long (93 per cent).

What people thought would beÂ temporary situation -- perhaps two week propped up on the sofa with their laptop, or a month hunched over the kitchen table -- has quickly turned into a more long-term arrangement. Just last week, ministers in Wales said its ambition is to see about 30 per cent of the workforce staying at or near home in the long term.Â 

Owain Evans, chiropractor and member of the BCA, says thatÂ [prolonged home working](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/2020/07/17/wfh-winner-loser/)Â can lead to aches pains in the neck, shoulders, lower back and even your jaw.Â 

"Usually this is due to people working from spaces which aren't designed for a full day's work, making it difficult to maintain a good upright posture, which is what our spine needs," he said.

In July, researchers from the job discovery platformÂ [DirectApply created an avatar called 'Susan'](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/2020/07/17/wfh-winner-loser/)Â to show what the remote workers of the future could look like - and it's not a pretty sight. As a result of long-term working from home, Susan has hunched shoulders, purple bags under her eyes as a result of continued eyestrain and is severely overweight.

It sounds far-fetched, butÂ this reality may be closer than we think. A recent report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found home workers are spending 49 minutes longer in front of a screen each day, four extra hours per week, than when they were in the office.

Dr Craig Mclean, fromÂ [Chiro London](https://www.chiro.london/),Â a chiropractors clinic with a base in Marleybone, has seen a rapid increase in clients seeking help for postural issues since the move to working from home was first announced, adding that these are mostly caused by "people cramped into work from home positions."

However, Mclean says thatÂ phones are actually the biggest culprit of upper body pain. The hunched posture phone usage encourages (shoulders forward, with the neck bent down) can have an effect on 'cervical lordosis'. This is essentially when your spine in the neck region doesn't curve as it normally should.

"The reverse curve you have in the bones of your neck is designed to keep your head pretty much weightless on top of the shoulders," he says. "The moment you lose some of the curve [the lordosis], you end up doubling the amount of work your muscles at the back of your spine need to do."

Indeed, the problem is so pronounced that McClean predicts a "posture pandemic" among the younger generation.Â Figures from the BCA reveal that 68 per cent of chiropractors have seen an increase in children with issues linked to screen timeÂ in the last five years. Although it may feel unnatural,Â experts recommendÂ holding your phone up to eye level, resting your elbow on your body for support.

Mclean cites the second and third biggest causes of upper bodyÂ pain as laptops, and poor positioning of devices, such as monitors. This is because laptops either force us to look down to see the screen orÂ (if it's elevated) raise ourÂ hands to type.

And it's not just muscle pain that homeworkers are grappling with.Â According to McClean, headaches calledÂ cervicogenic tension -Â caused by excessive stress to the neck - are becoming increasingly common.

"You end up irritating your nervous system that gives you a tension headache that can refer all the way round to the front of the head," he says. "More often than not, this takes the form of a dull, throbbing headache deep in the base of the skull."

[Telegraph 365 newsletter REFERRAL (article)](https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/40cd8a66-f5fa-4b01-828e-6ab606701740.html "Telegraph 365 newsletter REFERRAL (article)")

Largely, this is all caused by poor posture.Â "All you've got to do is put your head forward and your chin up a bit, and you can feel how jammed it feels at the top of your neck," adds McClean.

There are things you can do to work more healthily though -- and it starts with getting an appropriateÂ chair. To avoid slouching forward on to your desk space, Jones recommends always having a chair with good back support to help keep your spine in a neutral position. If you don't want to invest in an ergonomically designed desk chair, then sit with a cushion against the back of the chair with your back fully against it.

"Vary your work position too -- a good trick is to use your kitchen surfaces or an ironing board, so you can work standing up for a while," he added.

Breaks are important too. Although he says that "good posture looks different for everyone", Jones recommends that everyone changes his or her posture regularly: "If you're sitting for a long time, simply getting up and moving around every 20-30 minutes can make a massive difference (an easy trick is to stand up every time you're on the phone)."

Anji McGrandles, a workplace mental wellbeing expert and founder ofÂ [The Mind Tribe](https://www.themindtribe.co.uk/), agrees. She says if you feel as if you aren't taking enough breaks, the '20-20-20' rule can help; every 20 minutes, look at an object 20 feet away or more for at least 20 seconds to help your eyes readjust

"The key is to recreate your office space at work as much as possible. Keep your frequently used items within reach to avoid stretching and straining and try to avoid crossing your legs, as this can create a lot of posture problems," she says.

McGrandles recommends using external equipment, such as a keyboard of a mouse to help ease back and neck discomfort. SheÂ says thatÂ your monitor should be positioned 20 - 30 inches from your face, and centred straight ahead. Apparently, your eye levels shouldn't fall below the top third of the screen.

It may sound like a lot but these simple lifestyle tweaks can save you a lot of pain down the line in the future. Since making adjustments to her workspace based on the chiropractors recommendations, Sellem has found that her back pain has vastly improved. Now, she works in "small bursts" rather than staying immobile for hours.

"I still have pain on some days when there's a lot of online meetings and I can't take proper breaks, but on days when I can actually apply the chiropractor's advice I feel absolutely fine," she says.
